		<p>Hello there! I am Gabby Lazarcheff! I am from Oakhurst, CA, which is a
		small town right outside Yosemite National Park, and I am a Communications
		Design Major with a concentration in Visual Design. Art has always been a
		big part of my life! I love music, crafts, drawing, and journaling.
		I also love to listen to audiobooks and watch movies.</p>

		<p> I am very excited to learn how to code as it is something that I have
		never done before! I hope that after this class I will be able to take
		what I have learned and apply it towards my degree and design interests!</p>
