				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this lab was to create our Lab 7 Index and create a
					style sheet to style it with.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="problems">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> We had to experiment to figure out what looked good aesthetically to
					us. We had trouble figuring out how to style our classes and IDs but
					referred to W3 Schools for help. We also used the inspect feature to
					test different elements and refine our page layout.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="results">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>In the end we each created a stylized webpage complete with images,
				colored backgrounds, margins, and borders. </p>
