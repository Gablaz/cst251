			<h1>Hello World</h1>

			<section>My partner is Amanda. We met last semester when we had to do a group
				project together in our FYS 145 class. We found that we work well
				together, and we are excited for the opportunity to work together again as
				partners for CST251 Web Tools. We are both very new to coding, but we are
				looking forward to the chance to learn! Our attitudes towards education
				are very similar and we are both comfortable with taking on more
				leadership roles in classroom settings. We also both enjoy creating
				digital art and are Communication Design majors hoping to focus on visual
				design.
