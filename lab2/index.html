		<h1>Hello World</h1>

		<p>My partner is Amanda. We met last semester when we had to do a group 
			project together in our FYS 145 class. We found that we work well
			together, and we are excited for the opportunity to work together again as
			partners for CST251 Web Tools. We are both very new to coding, but we are
			looking forward to the chance to learn! Our attitudes towards education
			are very similar and we are both comfortable with taking on more
			leadership roles in classroom settings. We also both enjoy creating
			digital art and are Communication Design majors hoping to focus on visual
			design.</p>
