				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab was to try out the different CSS Selectors.
						We attempted to style every element of a specific class, a specific
						element with a class name, more than one element at a time, an
						element inside another element, and the hover feature of an image.
						</p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We ran into some issues when trying to specify the element(s) we
						wanted to style in our stylesheet. We referred back to the notes,
						used W3Schools, and shared our screens when we got stuck. </p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We have a web page where we styled, specific elements, all the
						elements in a class,  an image, and multiple elements at once. We
						now have a better understanding of how to create a CSS stylesheet
						and CSS selectors.</p>
