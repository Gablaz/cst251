		<h1>Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>

		<h2>Challange</h2>

		<p>The purpose of this lab was to test our files locally and publish them to
			the server through Github.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>

		<p>Fortunately we have been pushing our files to the server since Lab 2, so
			we did not run into any problems.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>We created a document describing the challenge, problems, and results
				of the lab. We added heading, subheading, paragraph, and image tags and
				then successfully published our files to the server through Github.</p>
