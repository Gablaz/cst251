			<p>Hi I'm Gabby! I am from Oakhurst, CA, which is a	small town right
				outside Yosemite National Park. I am a Communications Design Major
				with a concentration in Visual Design. I love music, crafts, drawing,
				and journaling. I also love to listen to audiobooks and watch movies.
				Some of my favorite movies include Star Wars, Marvel and other action/
				adventure movies. I played tennis in high school as well as piano
				(which I am quite terrible at).

				<p>The purpose of this lab was to experiment with block level styling
					using CSS.

			<section id="problems">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>We did not encounter any major problems during this lab. We merely
					had to experiment with and adjust the margins, padding, placement and
					size of the various elements to get the looks we wanted.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="results">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>We created a lab page that contained styled block elements with
					maximum and minimum width settings, specific positions, and a homepage
					link with a sticky position.
