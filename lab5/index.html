		<h1>Lab 5: More HTML</h1>

		<h2>Challange</h2>

		<p>The purpose of this lab was to create a page that had images and links to
			different pages. The purpose was to also apply different methods of
			displaying links such as linking both text and images.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>

		<p>Since we already knew how to add images and we had the lecture to refer
			back to, we finished the lab with ease. When we got stuck we would look
			back at the lecture powerpoint.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>We created web pages that contain multiple images and display links
				through images and text. We also added a link that takes you back to the
				homepage from the lab page.</p>
