				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this lab was create a series of prototype designs for
					my project team. We were instructed to produce fifteen sketches, three
					different designs for five overall ideas.

				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I had some trouble with getting started. It took some time to loosen
					up and draw without getting stuck or overly critical. Eventually, I
					was able to sketch some quick designs and get my ideas down on paper.

			<section id="results">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> I completed three sketches for each of my five webpage ideas for a
					total of fifteen designs. I enjoyed the process and feel that I was
					able to explore different ideas and possible layouts for my teamâ€™s
					final project.
