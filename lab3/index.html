			<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
				<article>
					<h2>Challange</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab was to create well organized local file
						structures, as well learning to add images and links within our website.
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had some trouble when inserting images because we had to resize them
						and we continuously forgot to add closing tags.</p>

						<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>Thankfully, most of our file structure was already complete due to the
							template we downloaded at the beginning of the class. In the end, we
							were able to add images to our pages as well as a bulleted list of our
							labs on our home pages. We also used techniques we already learned to
							add heading, subheading, and paragraph tags in order to create a well
							organized document. Overall, this lab strengthened our confidence and
							understanding of HTML and file structure.</p>
