				<h2>Feedback</h2>
					<p>I enjoyed presenting my quick sketches to my teammates, and I received
					some great feedback. The process really helped me think of some new ideas
					and refine my project sketches. My teammates seemed most excited about my
					“Art Gallery and Museum” themed idea. They liked the idea of frames
					surround our various images as well as the idea of displaying our contents
					in a gallery like format. They felt it could be a really creative and fun
					design for the website. My teammates were however less than impressed with
					my ideas for homepage layouts. We decided that my designs felt too
					cluttered and compressed, and they encouraged me to create more
					traditional and spread out homepages. My team also encouraged me to
					simplify some of my other designs and develop ways to make the site more
					user friendly with easier access to pages or different elements of the site.

				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this lab was create a second draft of sketches for our
					final project after receiving feedback on our previous sketches from
					our group members.

				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I had some trouble with getting started. It was a bit difficult for
					me to re-imagine and alter some of my designs to fit my team’s
					feedback and comments. Eventually, I was able to sketch the desired
					designs while keeping some of my original ideas and elements.

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> I worked off my team’s feedback and further developed three of my
					best ideas from the previous lab. I enjoyed the process and feel that
					I was able to explore different ideas and possible layouts for my
					team’s final project.
